    "By now, you should have a solid understanding of a few of the data types that Python makes available to everyone: Numbers, Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries.  But often times we want to do more with Python than using it as a fancy calculator or simple word processor.  Sometimes we need python to many actions together that will be completed over and over again.  Let's take a look at a set of statements that calculates the first 10 elements of the Fibonacci series."

    "\n",
    "- Next, we define a variable called `current_index` to help keep track of which element we are adding to the list next. When we initialized the list in line 1, we already defined the values for index `0` and index `1` (remember that lists start with an index of `0`), so since our list already has two elements, our next index to calculate is `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `while` line starts a loop that will execute all the statements that are in the body until the condition that is provided is no longer true (`current_index < 10`).  In Python, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false.  This test uses a simple comparison `<`, but we can use many different kinds of comparisons such as `>`, `==`, `<=`, or any expression that results in a boolean value (either `True` or `False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The _body_ of the loop is indented.  Indention is how Python decides that statements should be grouped together.  All of the statements that should be in the body of the function need to be indented the exact same number of spaces (usually 4).  Most Python editors know to automatically indent lines in a group, but they don't know when you are done with the grouping, so it's up to you to un-indent when you are done closing the body.  You will see in the example above, that the first three lines under the `while` statement are indented which means that these will continue executing until our conditional statement no longer evaulates to `True`. However, the final `print()` lines are not indented. That means that our statements inside the `while` body will execute multiple times before our `print` statements are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside of the body of our `while` loop, we calculate the next fibonacci value by adding the previous two fibonacci values from our list, and then we add our new value to the end of the list using the built-in `.append()` function for lists.  We must also increment our `current_index` or else our `while` condition will never evaulate to false and we will be stuck in an [infinite loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IbRujko-A)."
