This test uses a simple comparison `<=` (less than or equal), we can use many different kinds of comparisons `>`, `==`, `<=` for instance or any expression that results in a boolean value (e.g. `True` or `False`)\n",
    "- The _body_ of the loop - the statements to be executed when the condition is `True` are indented.  Indention is how Python decides that statements should be grouped together.  All the statements that should be in the body of the function need to be indented the exact same number of spaces (usually 4), most Python editors know to automatically indent lines in a group, but they don't know when you are done with the grouping, so it's up to you to un-indent when you are done closing the body.\n",

If the statement no results in `False` (such as when the value of `counter` becomes 11), then Python skips the indented statements and continues executing the program, in this case the final `print()` statement."
