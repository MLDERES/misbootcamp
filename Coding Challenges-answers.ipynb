For each one there are few hints that you can use if you get stuck.  Each challenge has a space for you to write the answer and a cell following which can be executed to check your answer against a few test cases."

Tuples are represented by the parathenses surrounding a comma separated list of items such as (5,6) or ('mother', 'daughter').  In the first case, the tuple is made up of two integers and the second case the tuple is two strings.  Accessing items in a tuple is similar to accessing items in other sequences in Python - by using square brackets.\n",
